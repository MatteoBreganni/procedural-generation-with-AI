# Procedural Generation with AI

This work presents an analysis of innovative techniques in procedural terrain generation, focusing on methods that combine traditional procedural algorithms with modern machine learning approaches. The goal is to enhance realism, quality, and controllability in the creation of virtual landscapes.

Two advanced approaches have been examined: one leveraging a hybrid technique that integrates Perlin Noise with Neural Style Transfer to generate stylized, customizable heightmaps; the other employing a disentangled generative model based on a modified StyleGAN2 architecture, enabling high-quality, interpretable, and precise terrain editing.

Both methods represent significant advancements in the field, offering new possibilities for applications such as video game development, simulations, and computer graphics, where realistic and flexible environment generation is essential.
